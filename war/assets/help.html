			<p>Please have a look at the video tutorial given in <i>about</i> page. In this section the functionalities of each screen is explained.
			<h4>Home screen</h4>
			<p>Helps to check the safety of the route based on the start and stop location given by the user. The route is considered as safe when you see lesser marks on the route.
			By default only those marks which are created on the current date will be displayed. But user can choose following options for more details. <br>
			a) Yesterday <br>
			b) Last week <br>
			c) Last month <br>
			d) Last year <br>
			e) All<br>		
			To get a tabular safety report, click on <i>Get report</i> button.
			</p>	
			<h4>Report screen</h4>
			<p>Report screen will display the number of marks which are created in the given bounds. Values of the bounds are decided by the start and stop locations given by the user
			in the home screen. Mark counts are displayed in a tabular format for current day, yesterday, last week, last month, last year and all.		
			</p>
			<h4>Community screen</h4>
			<p>When a user lands on the community page, the room location will be defaulted to the country on which he/she located. All the marks which are created in that country will also be 
			displayed. And new marks will be displayed as and when they are created. User can choose a different room he/she likes. When a new location is entered, all the marks which are created in that
			location will be displayed to him/her. And when new marks are created, that will also be presented to the user. Users can like, dislike or star any marks. Star is used in a situation
			when she/he finds the mark very useful. 		
			</p>
			<h4>Mark screen</h4>
			<p>Mark page is also having a field which accepts any place name. By default the map in the page will be centered with the current location of the user; provided he has enabled browser location.
			User can choose his place from the field where she/he wants to create the mark. In order to create a mark, first of all, user has to click on a particular point on the map. Then a red mark
			will be displayed on the map. User can remove the red mark by a mere right click on it. As a second step to create a mark, user has to click on the red mark which will pops up an information window.
			The window will have drop down boxes for category, transport mode, reason/nature and severity. The values in each of the select boxes are given below.<br>

			will be navigated to next screen in the same window. Just to ensure that the user is not a robot, he/she has to fill a basic mathematical formula and complete the process by clicking submit button which 
			will create a new marker. When the mark is created he will also get notified in the page.  		
			</p>

			<p>There are two ways in which user can reach account page. Either by clicking on the login/username link or directly selecting the account tab. If the user is not logged in, the page will be
			rendered with various open authentication service providers. User can choose any of these services and login to RouteMarks. When he/she logs in, the page will display a green card which contains all of the user
			activities, points, etc.
